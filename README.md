# Cancer Diagnosis Classification
The Cancer.csv dataset contains data related to cancer diagnoses, providing information about various features and characteristics of diagnosed tumors. It is a valuable resource for tasks such as classification, aiming to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the provided features. This README file provides an overview of the dataset and outlines the implementation of four classification techniques: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Dataset Description
The Cancer.csv file consists of 32 columns, including an identification number (ID) for each diagnosis and features such as:

* Mean radius
* Texture
* Perimeter
* Area
* Smoothness
* Compactness
* Concavity
* Symmetry
* Fractal dimension
Each feature column provides different measurements related to these characteristics, such as mean values, standard errors, and worst values. The dataset offers a comprehensive set of tumor attributes, making it suitable for cancer research, tumor analysis, and the development of predictive models.

## Classification Techniques
* The Cancer.csv dataset can be effectively utilized for implementing various classification techniques. Here, we present the implementation of four popular classification algorithms:

* Naive Bayes: This probabilistic classifier assumes independence among features and calculates the probability of a tumor being malignant or benign based on the provided feature values.

* Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression models the relationship between the tumor features and the probability of malignancy. It estimates the coefficients for each feature to classify tumors accurately.

* Decision Tree: Decision Trees create a tree-like model to split the dataset based on different features and their values. It can capture complex relationships between features and the target variable.

* Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the tumors into malignant and benign classes. It maximizes the margin between the classes to achieve better classification results.

## Usage
* Clone the repository
* Navigate to the project directory: cd your-repo
* Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy).
* Run the desired classification script (e.g., python naive_bayes.py).
* Analyze the classification results and evaluate the performance of each technique.
* Feel free to modify and customize the code according to your requirements. Experiment with different classification techniques, feature selection methods, and performance evaluation metrics to enhance the accuracy of cancer diagnosis predictions.
